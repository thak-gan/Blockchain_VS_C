# Blockchain_VS_C
Voting System using Blockchain.
A blockchain is typically a chain of blocks containing some amount of information. Each blockchain has three components: Data, Hash and Hash of Previous block.
We are working on a Voting System using Block chain since its more secure and doesnt let us rely on a third party to count and secure votes.
One of the key features of using Blockchain in this project is the concept of PoW otherwise known as Proof of Work. Takes a considerable amount of time to add a new block. This ensures blocks cannot be tampered.
If ever the blocks must be tampered with, one will have to access more than 51% of systems on the network at the same time.
